# This is a repository following the Udemy course [here](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-angular-and-spring-mvc-web-application)

# Notes (from current video)
    - We use connection pooling because creating connections to the database can be very expensive so using connection pooling
    is a best practice. 
        - By using connection pooling we can use the existing connections and prepared statements so we can avoid the cost of
        establishing connections. 
    - In the video the MySQL URL is just running on localhost, for my db.properties I am using docker so it is a slightly different
    configuration than in the video.
        - Also it's important I am writing the user name and password inside of the file because I am not
        connecting to a production level database where I am worried about security. 

# Summary
- I am watching this as I still need to improve my skills using Angular and Spring MVC to build full-stack web applications.
